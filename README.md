# grantnav-datavisualisations

Data is taken from http://grantnav.threesixtygiving.org/ by searching for keywords (these become themes).

The data is aggregated correctly, and everything pre-2018 is dropped. That json forms the basis for the fun bucket animations.

A working version of this project is here: https://grantnav-dataviz.firebaseapp.com
